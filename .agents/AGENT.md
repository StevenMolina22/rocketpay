# 🤖 Agent Guide

This document defines how an agent should operate within this project. **Follow these instructions strictly.**

---

### 🧭 Project Awareness & Context

- **Always read `.agents/PLANNING.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Check `.agents/TASKS.md`** before starting a new task. If the task isn’t listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Check `.agents/RULES.md`** for any rules the project has.
- **Check `.agents/CONTEXT.md`** for the context and files of the project.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `.agents/PLANNING.md`.

---

### 🧱 Code Structure & Modularity

- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
- **Use clear, consistent imports** (prefer relative imports within packages).

---

### ✅ Task Completion

- **Mark completed tasks in `.agents/TASKS.md`** immediately after finishing them.
- **Add discovered bugs or sub-tasks** during development under “Discovered During Work” in `.agents/TASKS.md`.
- **Focus ONLY on the requested problem or feature**.
  - If unrelated issues are found, log them under “Discovered During Work.”
  - Do not fix unrelated issues unless they block the current task.

---

### 📚 Documentation & Explainability

- **Update `README.md`** when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
- **Update `.agents/`** when new features are added, tasks are done or there is any relevant change on the codebase, **ALWAYS** make sure the `.agents/` folder is up to date with the codebase.
- **For complex logic, add inline `# Reason:` comment** explaining the why, not just the what.

---

### 🧠 AI Behavior Rules

- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code.
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from `.agents/TASKS.md`.
- **Focus ONLY on the problem and prompt at hand** Do not build unrelated features.
- **ALWAYS plan before codign complex tasks** Wait for approval before proceeding with implementation.
- When planning, analyze options first — don’t implement until requested.
- Install new dependencies only if absolutely required by the task.
- If an error occurs during execution or installation, document the error in `.agents/TASKS.md` and propose a resolution before proceeding.
- Use environment variables over hard-coded keys.

---

### Coding Rules

- Use `pnpm` on node if possible, except if other package manager is being used.
- Always use `uv` as a python manager. Run libraries with `uv run ...`.
- For `python` testing use `assert` when enough or `pytes` when necessary.
- Always prefer typescript over javascript.
- Always prefer ES-modules in JS.
- Always use function components in `react`.
- Always use modern type hints in python (3.13+).

## ✔️ Summary

**Stick to these principles.**
Keep `.agents/` and the codebase in sync.
Communicate context, plan carefully, commit small, test everything.
If you’re unsure — ask.
No assumptions.
No shortcuts.
